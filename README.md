# [Release] VoiceMarker

## Features

A FiveM mod for GTA that adds a marker to the player while they are talking. 
Has a  config file to adjust the marker type, size, location, color, optional bouncing, rotation, locked direction, showing text, text alignment.
INFO: You CAN set the marker height to a NEGATIVE number to bring it lower like FamilyRP-Style-Voice with their circle on the players feet (default) or positive to be above the head (like the Simms marker)
I basically took BTNGaming's version and customized it from my preferences. Added the text display.

This has been tested with the mumble-voip/rp-radio combination installed and works perfectly.

It can also be used with the default voice chat.

I think it will work with just about any chat mod if that mod doesn't hijack the basic cfx voice mechanism.

## Credits
